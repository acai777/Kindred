# Kindred

Kindred is an application to manage contacts. 

The focus in building Kindred is frontend DOM manipulation. In particular, there is a debouncing feature on the search bar, such that contacts are filtered after the user finishes typing. No frontend frameworks were used. 

To get started, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/acai777/Kindred.git
```

```
Now, go to the project root directory i.e., run `cd Kindred`
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the page.
