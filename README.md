# Kindred

Kindred is an application to manage contacts. 

The focus in building Kindred is frontend DOM manipulation. In particular, there is a debouncing feature on the search bar, such that contacts are filtered after the user finishes typing. No frontend frameworks were used. 

To get started, run the following:


1. Run `git clone https://github.com/acai777/Kindred.git`
2. Now, go to the project root directory i.e., run `cd Kindred`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the page.
